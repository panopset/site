<h1>Desktop Application License</h1>
<p>
Panopset desktop software is currently free, for anyone who can't afford it, and <a href="https://github.com/panopset/src">open source</a>.
</p><p>
If you and/or your business is doing fine, it is $25.00 per year.  Proof of <a href="mailto:karldinwiddie@gmail.com">payment</a> is the license.
</p><p>
Limited offer: $100.00 for a lifetime license, per user.
The first 1,000 who pay for a special permanent license, also get a numbered signed certificate
that they'll want to save in case Panopset ever goes public, or is sold.
</p>

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
This site contains Google analytics javascript, which collects information about your 
location and browser, in the same manner as any other site that uses Google analytics.

<p>
Here is a link to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US">Google privacy policy</a>.
</p>
<p>
While using the tools available on this site, information that you enter into fields is 100% transmitted 
through <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a> secured https, and processed in server
memory solely for the purpose of your immediate data processing cycle.  That information is not
stored anywhere.  When using Panopset desktop applications, nothing is transmitted outbound except
a request for version information, from the server to your application, so that it may flag you if you need an 
upgrade.  All other Panopset desktop software processing is done using files that you select, and in local RAM.
All of this is <a href="https://github.com/panopset/src">open source</a>, allowing for easy verification.
</p>
<p>
Panopset Android applications also fall under Google's privacy policy, and don't transmit any information to Panopset.

<p>
In summary, other than whatever Google is up to with the services noted above, 
<a href="panopset_privacy_policy.html" th:href="${static_host} + 'panopset_privacy_policy.html'">we don't store your data, period.</a>
