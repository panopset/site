In a galaxy barely within the bounds of the observable universe from Earth, there is a planet at the microbial stage
of evolution.

This planet orbits a medium-sized red dwarf, but

Future descendents of the inhabitants of this particular primordial muck will have over 300 billion years to evolve,
unlike the sorry lot on Earth destined to flame out shortly after only their first intelligent life evolution cycle.

Like us however, they compete for resources from the get go.

Who will win?
